Texting APP

This app is intended to give the user the same feel they get when they using their built in iMessages app.

By utilizing the free vonage api I'll enable visitors to simply put their friends number in and begin communicating.

The user will see a screen that resembles their iMessage app and they'll be asked to put their recipients name and phone number.

Once they've put their info they can begin texting for free!

The vonage api will send/receive the messages and I will add event listeners and CSS to create the iPhone athletic.  It will be responsive so that it looks great mobile and on a desktop.

Depending on how much time I have I would like to add the ability to upload their friends photo so that it feels more realistic during the chat but if they don't I will add a letter icon like iPhones do.

I want to add a real dynamic clock into the iPhone screen and I want to make sure that the bubbles are blue and gray.

1. User will need to fill out a form so that the system will have the following info  
    -Recipient name
    -Recipient phone number
    -Sender name (this will be inclided at the end of each message that is delivered using this tool)

2. User will have the ability to assign a contact photo to the virtual phone  (I would need to set the image src to their photos URL)

3. Once the questions are filled out the user should have the ability to type in a message which will be saved as a variable
    the variable will be included in the api function when the user hits send

4. Once the message is sent a "delivered" || "message failed to deliver" will appear under the message just like an iMessage

5. When the recipient responds their message will appear on the virtual iPhone

6. There will be a realtime clock on virtual phone at all times
    this clock should timestamp when a message is sent or received. realtime clock should not display seconds.

7. The messages should move up on the virtual phone as more messages are sent and recived.  I think this will be one of the tough parts for me to complete.  I may just allow it to be placed from the top to the bottom for ease.
