Texting APP

This app is intended to give the user the same feel they get when they using their built in iMessages app.

By utilizing the free vonage api I'll enable visitors to simply put their friends number in and begin communicating.

The user will see a screen that resembles their iMessage app and they'll be asked to put their recipients name and phone number.

Once they've put their info they can begin texting for free!

The vonage api will send/receive the messages and I will add event listeners and CSS to create the iPhone athletic.  It will be responsive so that it looks great mobile and on a desktop.

Depending on how much time I have I would like to add the ability to upload their friends photo so that it feels more realistic during the chat but if they don't I will add a letter icon like iPhones do.

I want to add a real dynamic clock into the iPhone screen and I want to make sure that the bubbles are blue and gray.
